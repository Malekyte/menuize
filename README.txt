## Quick Start

Menus are comprised of three primary objects: Shells, Nodes, and Pointers. Each Menu is contained under a single Shell, with multiple Nodes in a tree hierarchy. A Pointer object is used to control the operational position and walking of the Shell's Nodes (a.k.a cursor object functionality).
